One of the newest features of ISys++ 1.0.1 - 1.0.2 is `import`. Importing code from other files helps manage your code efficiently.

There's also `if` statements now to control your code even better.

Even after there's just general bug fixes and parser upgrades.

Another feature is the new lexer. This fixes issues with the recognition and was easier to use.

`("hello) world")` -> hello

New:

`("hello) world")` -> hello) world

## Optional Features

You have the option to build the ISys++ project with an experimental feature called module loading.
